| Event black list                | Events that should be signalled by the monitor tooling are listed on the event blacklist. This means that an alert occurs when the event takes place. The operations team can then take action. | 事件黑名单          | 由监控工具报出的事件被列在事件黑名单上。这意味着当事件发生时有告警出现。运维团队可依据告警采取措施。 |          |
| Event catalogue                   | An event catalogue is a list of all events of an application including the identification and the category(information, warning or exception).  | 事件目录          | 事件目录是一个应用的所有事件列表，包括ID号和类别（信息，警告或例外） 。 |         |
| Event management                     | This is an ITIL@ process that defines which events are valuable to recognize and to capture.These may be information events such as starting or stopping a process. It is also possible that there is a probability of an exception.This is called a warning. An example is the 80% full disk. In case the application or infrastructure component does not function properly, there is an exception. | 事件管理          | 事件管理是ITIL@的一个流程，该流程定义了值得去辨识和捕获的所有事件。这些事件可能是信息事件，如起或停止进程。也可能有发生例外的概率。这被叫作告警，如80%的磁盘空间满了。在应用或基础设施组件不能正常工作时，就发生了一个例外。  |   在MD中没有找到商标符合,暂时用@处理|
| Event white list                       | Events that are not relevant are placed on the white list. | 事件白名单          | 不相关的事件被列在白名单上。 |          |
| Exception                         | An exception is situation in which the normal flow of an application or system software component is disturbed. | 例外         | 例外是应用或系统软件组件的正常流程出现干扰的情形。 |          |
| Exception management                          | This is a process of determining potential disturbance, programming of the exception in the software, and monitoring of the exception in order to undo the effect.     | 例外管理              | 例外管理是一个为了消除影响的过程，该过程包括确定潜在干扰、设计软件异常处理以及监控例外。                                   |          |
| False negative                  | The application raises an error that causes an exception, while there in fact is no error.                     | 误报          | 应用带来一个引发例外的错误，而事实上没有出现错误。                                             |    假负？      |
| False positive                            | The application does not raise an error on an event while in reality an incorrect situation has occurred.          | 漏报              | 应用没有带来一个事件错误，但不正确的情形确实出现了。                       |    假正？      |
| Feature  | A feature is a description of a piece of functionality that should not cost more than half a DevOps cycle time. A feature is described in terms of the business. Features are the epic building blocks and are differentiated in stories. | 特性 | 特性是一项功能的描述，该功能不耗费超过一半DevOps周期时间。特性是从业务角度描述的。特性是史诗构建块，在用户故事中是不同的。 |          |
| Feature branch                        | A feature branch approach means that every story or feature is developed on a separate branch. Only after a story is accepted by testers, it is merged to the trunk so as to ensure that the trunk is always releasable.  | 特性分支               | 特性分支方法意味着每个故事或特性被作为一个单独的分支进行开发。仅在故事被测试人员认可后，分支才能被合并到主干，以保证主干总是可发布的。                         |                  |
| Feature splitting                             | There are two ways to subdivide features across DevOps teams,namely a vertical feature split and a horizontal feature split.A vertical split of a feature means that one DevOps team will handle the feature.A horizontal split of a feature means that more than one DevOps team is involved in the realisation of the feature.  | 特性划分               | 在DevOps团队中，有两种特性划分的方式，即垂直特性划分和水平特性划分。特性的垂直划分意味着仅一个DevOps团队处理该特性。特性的水平划分意味着多个DevOps团队可一起实现该特性。 |                  |
| Flow                                | Within DevOps, often the Lean principles are used. One of the most appealing is flow.A DevOps team should deliver products by working in a particular cadence with no waiting times and no repairs.Therefore, a maximum time to market is realized with the least cost and the desired quality. | 流                 | 精益原则常常被用于DevOps实践中。流是最受偏爱的原则之一。一个DevOps团队应该以一种无等待时间、无修复的特定节奏交付产品。因此，产品投放市场的最大时间以最小的成本和期望的质量得以实现。 |                  |
| Forward Releasing                        | Forward Releasing is a concept that does not create any branches (release branches only) in the entire DTAP street,and no older versions can be restored.If there has been a bug in the T-A-P environment then the correction must be generated by the deployment pipeline.| 前向发布               | 前向发布是一个在整个DTAP环节中不建立任何分支（仅发布分支）的概念，且没有旧版本可恢复。如果在T-A-P环境中出现任何Bug，那么纠正必须要通过部署流水线来生成。 |                  |
| Functional Acceptance Test (FAT)                            | The functional acceptance test is used to verify that the happy path of the application works conform the functional requirements. The alternate path and error path should be tested too. | 功能验收测试(FAT)               | 功能验收测试用于验证应用快乐路经的工作符合功能需求。替代路经和错误路径也应该被测试。 |                  |
| Functional Decomposition                                 | This concept describes the idea that the realization of a product or service can take place from coarse to fine. In this way, the realization of ideas in the funnel,roadmap planning,release planning and sprint planning is completed.                                        | 功能分解                   | 这个概念描述了一个产品或服务可以采用从粗略到精细的方式来实现。以这种方式，想法是按照漏斗、路线图规划、发布规划和冲刺规划来实现的。                                           |                  |
| Functional design                             | A functional design describes what needs to be built. | 功能设计               | 功能设计描述了需要构建的功能。 |                  |

| Funnel                | A funnel is a metaphor used to indicate a selection pathway,see Figure 8-1.The graphical representation is a funnel. There are more ideas than can be realized.As an idea gets more shape and the business case becomes clearer,the idea drops into the funnel and finally gets picked up to be planned in the roadmap.The mission, vision, business goal and strategy to realize these are the main driving factors of the funnel.But also, aspects that the DevOps organisation needs to realize faster time-to-market or higher SLA norms are driving factors.  | 漏斗         | 漏斗是一种用于表示选择路径的表达，参见图8-1。该图形展示了一个漏斗。更多的想法可以通过漏斗模型实现。随着一个想法逐渐成形、业务案例更加清晰，该想法进入漏斗，并最终被挑选出来进行路线图规划。为实现这些想法的使命、愿景、业务目标和战略是漏斗的主要驱动因素。但DevOps组织需要实现更快的投入市场时间或更高的SLA标准等方面也是驱动因素。 |          |
| Health model                   | A health model is a concept used to determine which error paths are possible prior to the realization of a theme, epic or feature.This is never exhaustive, but if 80% of the possible disturbances can be determined, that's already a lot.During the lifecycle of the application, the health model can be further expanded.In addition to the determination of possible disturbances, the health model analyses is used to look at what information is then available to establish that the unwanted event has occurred.And more importantly, whether that situation is still happening at the moment.Finally, the health model indicates which monitor facility is capable of detecting this.  | 健康模型          | 健康模型用于在一个主题、史诗或特性实现前确定哪些错误路径是可能的。这种可能性是不能完全穷举的，但如果80%的可能干扰可以被确定，就已经很好了。在应用生命周期中，健康模型可以被进一步扩展。除了确定可能的干扰，健康模型被用于研究哪些信息可用于确立不想要的事件已经发生。而更为重要的是，这种情形在这一时刻是否还在出现。最后，健康模型表明哪个监控模块能够探测到这个缺陷。 |          |
| Horizontal feature split                    | In some service organisations, there is a need to have specialized DevOps teams that only can perform a part of a feature request. In that case for one feature request more DevOps teams have to work together to release the new of changed objects. The advantage is that such teams have very deep knowledge of the products they use and are able to deliver high quality. The disadvantage is that all most every feature must get a Go-life by at least two or more teams. | 水平特性划分          | 在一些服务组织中，需要仅执行一个特性请求的部分工作的专业化DevOps团队。在这种情况下，对一个特性请求，多个DevOps团队必须一起工作来发布新版本。这种做法的优点是这样的团队对他们使用的产品有非常深刻的认知、能够高质量交付。缺点是几乎每一个特性必须得到至少2个团队的上线许可。  |       |
| Impact                       | One of the strong and common used based practices of ITIL@ is the impact analyse of a change. The word “impact” however has two meanings. The first meaning is the scope of the change. So, which application and infrastructure components are in scope of a change (feature request). The scope indicates also the amount of money / time to realize the change. The second meaning of the word “impact” is the consequence of not managing the risks of the change. This impact is measured in losses of time, money, reputation,market share et cetera. | 影响          | 变更影响分析是基于ITIL@实践的最强、最常用的方法之一。然而，“影响”这个词有2个含义。第一个含义是变更的范围。如，哪个应用和基础设施组件在一个变更（特性请求）的范围内。范围也表示实现该变更的金钱/时间量。“影响”的第二个含义是：没能管理变更风险带来的后果。这种影响是通过时间、金钱、声誉、市场份额等损失来测量的。 |     在MD中没有找到商标符合,暂时用@处理      |
| Increment                         | The Agile way of working consists of building increments rather than a complete product or service. Each increment has an added value. The architecture of the product / service has to be designed that it allowed to evolve. | 增量         | 敏捷工作法由建设增量而不是整个产品或服务组成。每个增量都有增加的价值。产品/服务的架构被设计成可逐步进化。 |          |
| Information debt                          | This concept indicates that in the deployment there are pipeline tools that cannot be used optimal because in the past too few meta data have been provided to the objects which are used in the tools. For example, a test robot cannot select test cases for a regression test if it is not clear which test case belongs to the set of features and requirements that have not been changed.     | 信息债务              | 这个概念表示，在部署中有流水线工具，但不能被最优使用，因为在过去提供给工具使用对象的元数据太少。例如，如果不清楚哪个测试案例属于没有变更过的特性和需求集，测试机器人就不能为一个回归测试选择测试案例。                                   |          |
| Integration Test (IT)                  | This test checks whether the components / modules of one applications work together correctly. There is a little overlap with the component test. However, this test type is meant to be focused on more than one component. The component test is focused on one component.                     | 集成测试(IT)          | 集成测试检测一个应用的组件或模块是否可一起正确工作。该测试与组件测试有少量重叠。然而，集成测试聚焦于多个组件。组件测试聚焦于单个组件内。                                             |          |
| Iterative                            | The Agile way of working consists of cyclical building of a product and/or service. These cycles may be fixed like in Agile Scrum of may differ per delivery like in Kanban.          | 迭代              | 敏捷工作法由循环构建一个产品或服务组成。这些循环可以像Agile Scrum方法固定下来，也可以像Kanban方法每次交付可以不同。                       |   原文 of may 应该是 or may      |
| Key Performance Indicator (KPI)  | The KPI is defined to measure a Critical Success Factor (CSF).A CSF is a countermeasure for a risk that a target is not achieved.  | 关键绩效指标(KPI) | KPI被定义为测量关键成功因素（CSF）。CSF是对没有达成的目标风险的反向测量。 |          |

| Lifecycle management                | Tools, like people, have a lifecycle. Gartner's hype cycle is an important instrument to analyse in which life cycle step the tool is positioned.The adoption of brand new tools in the market has the advantage that many new technologies and insights are available in the new tools.The downside is the slight adoption by the market,which means that a tool may not be adopted and disappears from the market. Also, the stability of such a new tool is often less because growing pain still have to be eliminated.  | 生命周期管理         | 工具像人一样有生命周期。Gartner的技术循环曲线是分析工具在生命周期中所在位置的重要工具。在市场上全新工具的采用有如下优势，在新工具上有许多新技术和洞察力可用。市场少量使用且处于下降趋势的工具,意味着该工具可能不被采用并从市场消失。而且，这种新工具的稳定性常常是较差的，因为增长的痛点仍然需要被清除。 |          |
| Make or buy                   | Maintaining the tool portfolio also involves checking whether to develop or purchase a tool. Often it is not a black and white choice. It is a choice between customizing purchased tool and buying a more expensive tool that already has many features available.  | 自制或外购          | 维护工具组合也包括检查是开发还是外购工具。这常常不是一个黑白选择题。这是一个客户化外购工具和购买一个已有许多特性可用的更昂贵的工具之间的选择。 |          |
| Master test plan (MST)                     | A master test plan is used to define the test strategy. The test strategy is used to determine which test types are tested where en when and by whom in such a way that with the minimal effort the most important functions are tested to conform the requirements. | 主测试计划(MST)          | 主测试计划用于定义测试策略。测试策略用于确定对哪种测试类型进行测试，哪个环境，何时，由谁来测试。以这种方式，用最少的努力来测试最重要的功能符合需求说明。  |       |
| Merge                       | To merge is the opposite of branching. This involves combining two versions of the same S-CI where the conflicts are being looked up and eliminated.  | 合并          |合并是分支的反义。这包括将相同软件配置项的两个版本合成在一起，合并时查找冲突并清除。 |          |
| Meta data                         | Meta data is information that describes objects. An example is the meta data of a build.This meta data may consist of:BuildID;BuildDateTime;BaselineID;ApplicationID. | 元数据         | 元数据是描述对象的信息。一个例子是一次构建的元数据。这种元数据可能包括：构建ID；构建日期时间；基线ID；应用ID。 |          |
| Monitoring layer model                          | There are thousands of monitor tools from which a choice can be made for the monitoring of the deployment pipeline and in production.      | 监控层模型              | 有几千个监控工具可供部署流水线及生产环境的监控选择。                                   |          |
| One piece flow                  | An important concept of the deployment pipeline is to ensure that all DevOps team members are involved in one feature.And the flow is free of waste.                     | 单件流          | 部署流水线的重要概念是要保证所有DevOps团队成员都包括在一个特性中。单件流就是要避免浪费。                                             |          |
| Pattern                            | A pattern is a generic solution for a generic and recurring problem. By analysing the problems，a DevOps team faces and the way they solve their problem, patterns can be created and shared with other DevOps teams by telling stories. This article gives some patterns for the way in which DevOps teams can be organized.           | 模式              | 模式是对一般性和重复发生问题的通用解决方案。通过分析DevOps团队面对的问题及解决问题的方式，模式可以通过讲故事来建立并与其他DevOps团队分享。该文章给出了DevOps团队以这种方式组织的一些模式。                       |          |
| Pattern language  | Patterns can often be linked to a pattern language.This means that patterns together provide a generic solution for higher generic problem.  | 模式语言 | 模式常常与模式语言相关联。这意味着各种模式可以一起为较高层次的一般性问题提供通用的解决方案。 |          |
| Performance Stress Test (PST)  | The performance stress test is used to verify whether the system is capable of handling the request timely given a known number of users, transactions types and background workload.  | 性能压力测试(PST) | 性能压力测试用于验证系统是否能够及时处理已知数量的用户、交易类型和背景负载的请求。 |          |
| Primary key / Foreign key  | The ID's in objects are identifiers that uniquely identify objects. Many objects like a baseline and build have a relationship. There can now be a relationship between these objects by sharing a key field.For example, in the build object, a BaselineID can be included to indicate based on which BaselineID the build was built with the unique BuildID.The BaselineID is then the Primary Key that is registered in the Build object as Foreign Key.  | 主键/外键 | 对象中的ID是唯一标识对象的标识符。像基线和构建这样的许多对象是有关系的。通过共享键值域现在可以在这些对象间建立关系。例如，在构建对象中，可以包括一个基线ID，表示具有这个唯一构建ID的这次构建基于哪个基线ID。这个基线ID是主键，该主键在构建对象中被登记为外键。 |          |
| Process blue print | A process blue print is an example of an architecture model. The blueprint shows in one picture which service management processes are used in a service organisation and how vertical and horizontal governance is organized, without showing all communication lines in detail.  | 流程蓝图 | 一个流程蓝图是一个架构模型的例子。蓝图在一个图中展示在一个服务组织中哪些服务管理流程被使用、垂直和水平治理是如何组织的，图中并不显示所有的细节沟通连接线。 |          |
| Production Acceptance Test (PAT)  | The production acceptance test is used to verify the application works fine in the target environment.  | 生产验收测试(PAT) | 生产验收测试用于验证应用在目标环境中工作良好。 |          |
